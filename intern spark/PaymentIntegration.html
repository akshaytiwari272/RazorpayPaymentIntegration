        <P>9.6 million people die from cancer every year. Unfortunately, half a million deaths happen due to ignorance of the disease. 70% of Indiaâ€™s poor cancer patients lose their lives due to late detection of which 15% are children. Cancer survival depends on early diagnosis and access to medical treatment which the poor cannot afford. HelpIndia partner NGOs are providing free/low-cost treatment to poor cancer patients. Your small monthly donation can help a cancer care NGO to save lives by giving them a fair chance to fight cancer. </P>
